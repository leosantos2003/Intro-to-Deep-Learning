# Intro to Deep Learning
  
## About

This repository documents the learnings from completing the [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) course on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

The focus here is on the practical implementation of neural networks to solve a classification problem, using the TensorFlow framework and its high-level API, Keras. The goal is to learn how to build, train, and optimize dense (fully-connected) neural network architectures.

* `lesson_1`: a single neuron; linear units. [see graphic](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Deep-Learning/tree/main/lesson_1)

* `lesson_2`: deep neural networks; adding hidden layers to the network. [see graphic](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Deep-Learning/tree/main/lesson_2)

* `lesson_3`: stochastic gradient descent; using Keras and Tensorflow to train the first neural network. [see graphic](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Intro-to-Deep-Learning/tree/main/lesson_3)
 
* `lesson_4`: overfitting and underfitting; improving performance with extra capacity or early stopping.
 
* `lesson_5`: dropout and batch normalization; adding special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.
 
* `lesson_6`: binary classification; applying deep learning to another common task.
